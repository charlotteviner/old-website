            <h2>Advanced Skills: Portfolio of Practical Work</h2>
            
            <p>
                Below is a summary of the practical work from the <i>Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Advanced Skills</i> module. Links to 
                the repositories associated with each practical block are provided.
            </p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical1" target="_blank">ModelBuilder</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    The ModelBuilder practical introduced the concept of creating an ArcToolbox and making a new model within it. ModelBuilder is a fourth 
                    generation coding environment, and enables the creation of a basic ArcGIS program without having to handwrite any code using a simple 
                    drag-and-drop system. For this practical, an explosion model was created for the fictional Albert Square, which allows the user to 
                    investigate which buildings would be affected by an explosion at a given point. The model was then used to build a Python script.
                </p>
        
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical2" target="_blank">ArcPy Scripts</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical used the model built in the ModelBuilder practical, and the tool was run from the Python window, then from a seperate 
                    script, then as an addin, and finally from a Python toolbox. This was designed to show the full range of options for running Python in Arc.
                </p>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical3" target="_blank">ArcPy Addins</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    Building on the previous practical, here an addin toolbar and button was created and the code was run from these. Addins allow more 
                    sophisticated GUI elements to be created, and provides the ability to link addins together.
                </p>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical4" target="_blank">GUI/Display: Building an Arc Toolbar</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical built a crime analysis Python toolbar, which was used to analyse the chance of burglary in Albert Square. The practical 
                    involved building an addin toolbar with a button, a model to undertake the analysis, writing some code to sort and display the results 
                    and creating a script to run the model and code.
                </p>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical5" target="_blank">SQLite: Writing and Reading Databases</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical looked at writing and reading a SQLite database using Python.
                </p>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical6" target="_blank">XML</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical introduced XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and how it can be interacted with through Python, including validation, 
                    transformation, and different types of reading.
                </p>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical7" target="_blank">Data Processing: Pandas and Bokeh</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical introduced the 'pandas' and 'bokeh' libraries for Python and their use in processing and displaying datasets. The work 
                    mainly involved working through tutorials for both, using Jupyter Notebook.
                </p>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/practical8" target="_blank">Language Analysis: NLTK</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    In this practical, 'The Waste Land' by T. S. Eliot was parsed and proper nouns, specifically locations, in the text were found. These 
                    locations were then geocoded using the Google geocoding API.
