            <h2>Advanced Skills: Portfolio of Practical Work</h2>
            
            <p>
                Below is a summary of the practical work from the <i>Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Advanced Skills</i> module. Links to the repositories associated with each practical block are provided.
            </p>

            <h4>ModelBuilder</h4>
            
                <p>
                    The ModelBuilder practical introduced the concept of creating a new ArcToolbox and making a new model within it. ModelBuilder enables the creation of a basic Arc program without having to code.
                </p>
        
            <h4>ArcPy Scripts</h4>
            
                <p>
                    In this practical, a tool was run from the Python window and then the model, which was created in the ModelBuilder practical, was run from a script.
                </p>
            
            <h4>ArcPy Addins</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Building on the previous practical, here an addin toolbar and button was created and the code was run from these.
                </p>
            
            <h4>GUI/Display: Building an Arc Toolbar</h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical built a crime analysis Python toolbar, which was used to analyse the chance of burglary in an area. The practical involved building an addin toolbar with a button, a model to undertake the analysis, writing some code to sort and display the results and creating a script to run the model and code.
                </p>
            
            <h4>SQLite: Writing and Reading Databases</h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical looked at writing and reading a SQLite database.
                </p>
            
            <h4>XML</h4>
            
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/charlotteviner/dataprocessing" target="_blank">Data Processing: Pandas and Bokeh</a></h4>
            
                <p>
                    This practical introduced the 'pandas' and 'bokeh' libraries for Python and their use in processing and displaying datasets.
                </p>
            
            <h4>Language Analysis: NLTK</h4>
            
                <p>
                    In this practical, 'The Waste Land' by T. S. Eliot was parsed and proper nouns, specifically locations, in the text were found. These locations were then geocoded using Google.
                </p>
