        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="row">
             <div class="column left">
                <p>
                  I am a 22-year-old postgraduate student at the University of Leeds studying for a MSc in River
                  Basin Dynamics and Management with Geographical Information Systems. Prior to joining the University
                  of Leeds, I studied for a BSc in Environmental Geoscience at the University of Nottingham, graduating
                  with a first class honours degree.
                  <br><br>
                  Primarily, my academic interests focus around hydrology. I am particularly interested in river
                  geomorphology, and this formed the basis of my undergraduate dissertation. Over the past year,
                  I have become increasingly interested in developing my GIS skills and in learning new skills, such as
                  programming using Python.
                  <br><br>
                  This website is my online portfolio of work undertaken as a part of my academic studies. More
                  specifically, it is currently a portfolio of projects I have completed in Python. I have mainly
                  focused on agent-based models, one created during guided practical sessions for one of my Master's
                  modules, and the other created independently as part of an extended project.

        <h3>Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills</h3>

        <h4><a span style = "color:green" href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/practical.html">Core Skills Practical Portfolio: Agent-Based Model</a></h4>

        <p>
          During guided practical sessions, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.
        </p>

        <h4><a span style = "color:green" href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/project.html">Python Project</a></h4>
        <p>
          For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain moves within a landscape.
          The model maps the drainage network of the landscape and calculates the volume of rainwater that has reached
          an outlet point.
