                  After graduating with a BSc in Environmental Geoscience from the University of Nottingham in 2017, I studied for a MSc in River Basin Dynamics 
                    and Management with Geographical Information Systems at the University of Leeds before returning to Nottingham to start my PhD in 2019.
                  <br><br>
                  My research interests focus on fluvial geomorphology and ecology. My undergraduate dissertation assessed the role of underlying bedrock geology 
                    in determining geomorphological characteristics of two Peak District rivers, while my MSc dissertation investigated the impact of the invasive 
                    signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) on benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in English rivers and how these impacts 
                    affect the validity of using common biomonitoring scores for assessing water quality. My PhD combines fluvial geomorphology and ecology and 
                    aims to develop a model to predict sediment transport dynamics in rivers infested with signal crayfish.

            <h3>Research Summary</h3>
            
            <p>
                Invertebrate animals are known to disturb river beds and banks, altering sediment stability and transport. However, inclusion of biological 
                activity in models of fluvial sediment transport has not been widely investigated or applied. This project will determine the different 
                biogeomorphological roles of invertebrate animals and categorise them into functional groupings of invertebrate-sediment interactions. The 
                impact of invasive signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on fluvial sediment transport will then be considered and incorporation of their 
                impacts into sediment transport modelling frameworks will be attempted. Due to their large body size, high abundance, and burrowing behaviour, 
                signal crayfish have a particularly significant impact on sediment dynamics in UK rivers, making them a good example animal. This work aims to 
                increase accuracy of sediment transport prediction in infested rivers, allow for the extrapolation of the impacts of future invasion scenarios, 
                and provide an example modelling framework that can later be extended to other organisms.

            <p>
                During guided practical sessions, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.

            <p>
                For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain moves within a landscape. The model maps the drainage network 
                of the landscape and calculates the volume of rainwater that has reached an outlet point.
