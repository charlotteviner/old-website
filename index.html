        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="row">
             <div class="column left">
                <p>I am a 22-year-old postgraduate student at the University of Leeds studying for a MSc in River Basin Dynamics and Management with Geographical Information Systems. Prior to joining the University of Leeds, I studied for a BSc in Environmental Geoscience at the University of Nottingham, graduating with a first class honours degree.<br><br>Primarily, my academic interests focus around hydrology. I am particularly interested in river geomorphology, and this formed the basis of my undergraduate dissertation. Over the past year, I have become increasingly interested in developing my GIS skills and in learning new skills, such as programming using Python.<br><br>This website is my online portfolio of work undertaken as a part of my academic studies. More specifically, it is currently a portfolio of projects I have completed in Python. I have mainly focused on agent-based models, one created during guided practical sessions for one of my Master's modules, and the other created independently as part of an extended project.</p>

        <h4><a span style = "color:green" href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/practical.html">Practical Portfolio: Agent-Based Model</a></h4>
       
        <p>During guided practical sessions, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.</p>
        
        <h4><a span style = "color:green" href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/project.html">Python Extended Project</a></h4>
        <p>For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain moves within and exits a landscape. I then used this information to delineate catchment areas in the landscape.</p>
