        <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>
                  After graduating with a BSc in Environmental Geoscience from the University of Nottingham in 2017, I studied for a MSc in River Basin Dynamics and Management with Geographical Information Systems at the University of Leeds before returning to Nottingham to start my PhD in 2019.
                  <br><br>
                  My research interests focus on fluvial geomorphology and ecology. My undergraduate dissertation assessed the role of underlying bedrock geology in determining geomorphological characteristics of two Peak District rivers, while my MSc dissertation investigated the impact of the invasive signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) on benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in English rivers and how these impacts affect the validity of using common biomonitoring scores for assessing water quality. My PhD combines fluvial geomorphology and ecology and aims to develop a model to predict sediment transport dynamics in rivers infested with signal crayfish.

                  This website is my online portfolio of work undertaken as a part of my academic studies. More specifically, it is currently a portfolio of projects I have completed in Python for modules of my Master's degree.

            <h4><a href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/practical.html">Core Skills Practical Portfolio: Agent-Based Model</a></h4>

            <p>
                During guided practical sessions, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.
            </p>

            <h4><a href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/project.html">Individual Project</a></h4>

            <p>
                For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain moves within a landscape. The model maps the drainage network of the landscape and calculates the volume of rainwater that has reached an outlet point.
