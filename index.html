                  After graduating with a BSc in Environmental Geoscience from the University of Nottingham in 2017, I studied for a MSc in River Basin Dynamics 
                    and Management with Geographical Information Systems at the University of Leeds before returning to Nottingham to start my PhD in 2019.
                  <br><br>
                  My research interests focus on fluvial geomorphology and ecology. My undergraduate dissertation assessed the role of underlying bedrock geology 
                    in determining geomorphological characteristics of two Peak District rivers, while my MSc dissertation investigated the impact of the invasive 
                    signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) on benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in English rivers and how these impacts 
                    affect the validity of using common biomonitoring scores for assessing water quality. My PhD combines fluvial geomorphology and ecology and 
                    aims to develop a model to predict sediment transport dynamics in rivers infested with signal crayfish.

            <h3>Research Summary</h3>
            
            <p>
                Invertebrate animals are known to disturb river beds and banks, altering sediment stability and transport. However, inclusion of biological 
                activity in models of fluvial sediment transport has not been widely investigated or applied. This project will determine the different 
                biogeomorphological roles of invertebrate animals and categorise them into functional groupings of invertebrate-sediment interactions. The 
                impact of invasive signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) on fluvial sediment transport will then be considered and incorporation of their 
                impacts into sediment transport modelling frameworks will be attempted. Due to their large body size, high abundance, and burrowing behaviour, 
                signal crayfish have a particularly significant impact on sediment dynamics in UK rivers, making them a good example animal. This work aims to 
                increase accuracy of sediment transport prediction in infested rivers, allow for the extrapolation of the impacts of future invasion scenarios, 
                and provide an example modelling framework that can later be extended to other organisms.

                This study investigated the long-term changes to benthic macroinvertebrate community composition in English rivers invaded by signal crayfish 
                (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) and assessed the implications that these changes may have on the use of common biomonitoring indices for 
                examining water quality in invaded rivers. The findings of this study showed that benthic macroinvertebrate communities in rivers invaded by 
                <i>P. leniusculus</i> exhibit persistent and possibly permanent changes in composition, and consequently the use of biomonitoring scores for 
                the ecological assessment of invaded rivers may not be as reliable or accurate as in uninvaded rivers. This research contributes to the currently 
                limited understanding of the long-term effects of invasive crayfish in rivers and provides knowledge required for the future planning of river 
                management practices.

                For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain moves within a landscape. The model maps the drainage network 
                of the landscape and calculates the volume of rainwater that has reached an outlet point.

            <h4>“An Investigation into the Geomorphological Differences Between Two Peak District Rivers with Contrasting Bedrock Geology”</h4>
            
            <p>
                <b>Supervisor:</b> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/geography/people/m.johnson" target="_blank">Dr. Matthew F. Johnson</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                An extensive survey of two rivers in the Peak District was undertaken to investigate their geomorphological differences and to determine which 
                of these differences can be attributed to their contrasting bedrock geologies. Geomorphology was assessed using GIS analysis to examine the 
                longitudinal profiles, and field data was collected to analyse downstream hydraulic geometry relationships, grain size distributions, shear 
                stresses, and stream power in the rivers. This project highlights the complexity and variability that can be found in river systems and 
                demonstrates that geomorphology is often influenced by the interactions of multiple controls. This study contributes to the understanding of 
                how and why geomorphology differs between rivers, informing the planning of future river development and management strategies.
