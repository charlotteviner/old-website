I am a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds studying for a MSc in River Basin Dynamics and Management with Geographical Information Systems.

This is my online portfolio of work undertaken in Python as a part of one of my modules at the university. I have mainly focused on agent-based models, one created during the practical sessions and the other created independently.

During the practicals on this module, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.

For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain would move within and exit a landscape. I then used this information to delineate catchment areas in the landscape.
