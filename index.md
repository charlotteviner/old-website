## About Me

<span style = "color:blue">I am a postgraduate student at the University of Leeds studying for a MSc in River Basin Dynamics and Management with Geographical Information Systems.</span>

<span style = "color:green">This is my online portfolio of work undertaken in Python as a part of one of my modules at the university. I have mainly focused on agent-based models, one created during the practical sessions and the other created independently.</span>


## [Practical](https://charlotteviner.github.io/practical.html)

<h2 style="text-align:right"><a href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/practical.html">Practical</a></h2>

During the practicals on this module, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.

## [Project](https://charlotteviner.github.io/index2.html)

For my individual project, I have used an agent-based model to assess how rain would move within and exit a landscape
