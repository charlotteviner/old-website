        <p>
            This is my online portfolio of work undertaken in Python as a part of one of my modules at the university. I have mainly focused on agent-based models, one created during the practical sessions and the other created independently.

        <h4><a href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/practical.html">Agent-Based Model</a></h4>
        <p>During the practical work for this module, I created an agent-based model to simulate sheep eating a landscape.</p>
        
        <h4><a href="https://charlotteviner.github.io/project.html">Extended Project</a></h4>
        <p>For my extended project, I modelled how rain falls on and exits the landscape, and used this information to delineate the catchment areas. </p>
